#### Overview

This is a simple extension the <a href="http://stripesframework.org/display/stripes/Home">Stripes</a> 
Framework to allow for control over most, if not all, Stripes resources though CDI.

Currently we rely in the latest source from Stripes (1.6.0-SNAPSHOT) as it provides
all the necessary integration points to hook our claws into and control just
about every aspect of the application.

#### Currently Tested

* Simple Action Bean injection and control. Both RequestScoped, and Dependent scoped beans. (SessionScoped should be fine, just have not tested)
* URL mapping, lookup, and generation of CDI managed Action beans.
* RequestScoped variables and validation within ActionBeans (models).
